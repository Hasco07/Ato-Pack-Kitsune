# Public ATO Pack — “Kitsune” (Fictional System)

A **sanitized, fictional** RMF authorization package demonstrating how I structure SSP content, control narratives, and evidence in an assessor-friendly way.

---

## For Hiring Managers
**What this demonstrates**
- How I write **clear control implementations** (audit-ready narratives)
- How I organize **evidence** so it’s traceable, reviewable, and consistent
- How I structure a package to support **authorization + continuous monitoring**

**What to review first (5–10 minutes)**
1) `/0_system-overview/system-description.md`
2) `/1_rmf-artifacts/SSP.md`
3) `/2_controls-and-evidence/controls/` (pick any control file)
4) `/3_poam/poam-workflow.md`

**What’s intentionally omitted**
- Any real program details, templates, diagrams, hostnames, or evidence from secure environments  
All content is **fictionalized** for OPSEC/confidentiality.
