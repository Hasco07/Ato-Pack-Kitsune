# Log Sources (Fictional)

> Purpose: demonstrate that logging coverage is intentionally defined (not accidental).

## Primary log sources (examples)
- **Directory/IdP authentication logs** (success/failure, lockouts, policy changes)
- **Workstation OS security logs** (logon/logoff, privilege use, admin actions)
- **Server OS logs** (service start/stop, config changes)
- **Source control logs** (repo access, admin actions, key events) *(fictional)*
- **Build/CI logs** (build triggers, pipeline changes, artifact publishing) *(fictional)*
- **Vulnerability scanner summaries** (scan execution + results)
- **Patch management / compliance summaries** (installed patches, missing patches)
- **Controlled media transfer records** (if applicable)

## Notes
- Log sources and retention are reviewed periodically to ensure coverage remains complete as the boundary evolves.
