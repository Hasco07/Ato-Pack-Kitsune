# Inspection Readiness Runbook (Fictional)

## Goal
Be able to answer the “inspection questions” quickly:
- What is the system?
- What controls are in place?
- What evidence proves it?
- What are the known gaps (POA&M) and plans?

## 10-minute readiness drill
1) Open [SSP](../1_rmf-artifacts/SSP.md)
2) Open 5 key controls 
   - [AC-2](../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/AC-2.md)
   - [AU-2](../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/AU-2.md)
   - [CM-2](../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/CM-2.md)
   - [IA-2](../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/IA-2.md)
   - [SI-2](../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/SI-2.md)
4) Confirm evidence artifacts are present and dated
5) Review POA&M for overdue items and mitigation notes
6) Ensure the most recent monthly checklist is complete

## Evidence hygiene rules
- Dated files
- Clear naming
- No ambiguous “final_v7” filenames
- Paths referenced directly from controls
